Hello, I'm Alex. I am currently a senior enrolled in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
I enjoy creating side projects that allow me to test skills i've learnt through personal research as well as academically.
I also enjoy discussing with other programmers and sharing ideas/knowledge. I find that a different perspective is always insightful.
I am looking to further my knowledge of software systems and development.
To reach me my email is:
                        acrubaugh11@gmail.com
Thanks!

_Fun Fact_:
         I grew up across Africa and lived in over 4 different countries including Guinea, Tanzania, Ghana, and Zambia.
